cmeans.pro 	
			This file contains elementary, higher-level, helper functions to
			implement a SWI-Prolog version of the c-means algorithm. Each 
			function is declarative programming with no imperative contructs 
			used. At the bottom, it contains the training set, h, used in the 
			samples cases recorded in the file "sde3.log"

sde3.log
			This file contains a log of 33 test cases. 24 of the cases are 
			2 sample uses each for 14 of the required functions and the
			other 5 cases are for the last function (cmeans).
